# Plain text symbol definitions

Like Tracery, Bracery allows you to specify symbol definitions in JSON.
However, for convenience, Bracery also allows an (optional) plaintext format for symbol definitions. This lets you avoid typing so much distracting punctuation.

In the plaintext format, a symbol definition block begins with a greater-than symbol `>`, followed by the name of the symbol, then the end of the line.
Each subsequent line represents an alternate definition for that symbol. The block is terminated by a blank line.

For example, the following consists of two blocks:

~~~~
>body_part
head
leg
arm
foot
nose

>sentence
"Hey! Look at my #body_part#!"
My #body_part# feels [funny|odd|great].
The #body_part#-bone's connected to the #body_part#-bone.
~~~~

This is exactly equivalent to the following JSON definitions file.
Note how much less punctuation is needed for the plaintext version,
especially for the first expansion of `sentence` where JSON requires that the quotation marks be backslash-escaped:

~~~~
{
  "body_part": [
    "head",
    "leg",
    "arm",
    "foot",
    "nose"
  ],
  "sentence": [
    "\"Hey! Look at my #body_part#!\"",
    "My #body_part# feels [funny|odd|great].",
    "The #body_part#-bone's connected to the #body_part#-bone."
  ]
}
~~~~

Backslash-escaping works in the plaintext format, too; so you can use `\n` if you need a newline within a definition line.

The file [examples/travel.txt](examples/travel.txt) contains the `#hero# traveled with...` example in this plaintext format
([examples/travel.json](examples/travel.json) contains the same definitions in JSON).

## Import scripts

The [import/](#import/) directory contains scripts to import various word and phrase sets,
notably from Darius Kazemi's [corpora](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora).
Type `cd import; make` to run.

# Braceplate message sequences

Braceplates _(Bracery message templates)_ are a lightweight scheme for sequencing a series of Bracery messages in a Markov chain,
allowing for limited contextual continuity between successive messages.

## Tags

Each template has a set of _past-tags_ and a set of _future-tags_.
Tags are arbitrary strings, excluding spaces.
Matches between tags determine the connectivity of the Markov chain.

The past and future-tags are interpreted as follows:

- For template B to be considered as a possible successor (i.e. reply) to a message generated from template A, at least one of A's future-tags must also be one of B's past-tags
- If any of A's future-tags appear in B's past-tags with an exclamation point in front (e.g. A has future-tag `tag` and B has past-tag `!tag`), then B is disallowed as a successor to A (these tags are referred to as B's _excluded-past-tags_)
   - The minus sign is an alias for the exclamation point in past-tags, so `-tag` means the same as `!tag`
- If any of B's past-tags have a plus sign in front (e.g. B has past-tags `+tag`), then A _must_ have that tag in its future-tags.
- The special past-tag `root` is used to denote _root templates_ that can be used at the top of a thread (or the past-tags can be left empty for the same effect)

## Templates

Each Bracery message template has the following fields:

- the _past-tags_
- the _future-tags_
- the _title_
- the Bracery _source text_ that is used to generate individual messages from this template
- (optional) the name of the _sender_ (or, more generally, a user or NPC associated with the message)
- (optional, defaults to 1) the integer _weight_ of the template (used by the recommendation engine)

## Messages

An individual Braceplate _message_, generated from one of the above templates, exists in the context of a _thread_ of messages.
The first message in the thread must be generated from a root template, as described above.
Successive messages are generated by matching tags between consecutive templates.

Each message has the following fields:

- an associated template
- an _expansion tree_ that is a parse tree generated from the Bracery grammar defined by the template's source text
- a set of _future-tags_ which by default are the same as the template's future-tags, but can be overridden by the `$tags` variable, if that variable is assigned a value in the expansion tree
- (if not the first message in the thread) a _predecessor_ message, with appropriate overlap between the predecessor's future-tags and the template's past-tags

## Special variables

### Tags

The root node of the expansion tree "inherits" any variable assignments from the predecessor,
with two special variables overridden as follows:

- the `$tags` variable, at the beginning of the expansion, is set to the template's future-tags (joined by whitespace into a single string)
- the `$prevtags` variable, at the beginning of the expansion, is set to the predecessor message's future-tags (joined by whitespace into a single string)

The value of the `tags` variable by the end of the expansion is used to find the message's future-tags (it is considered to be a whitespace-separated list).
Thus, the template's default future-tags can be "overridden" by variable assignments from the Bracery source text.

### Footers

The special variable `$footer` also has significance, in that the Bracery code `&eval{$footer}` is implicitly appended to every message.
A common pattern is to set (or manipulate) `$tags` from within `$footer`.

### Accept/reject handlers

The variables `$accept` and `$reject` are reset to the empty string at the beginning of every message.
If, during the message, `$reject` is defined truthy (i.e. nonempty and non-whitespace), then the UI will interpret the player "reject" action
as an "accept" with `&eval{$reject}` appended to the message.
Similarly, if `$accept` is defined truthy, then the player "accept" action will append `&eval{$accept}` to the message.

This allows forced binary choice semantics, similar to a game like [Reigns](https://www.devolverdigital.com/games/view/reigns).
For example:

~~~~
The peasants riot for food. $accept={You distribute grain.} $reject={You crush the rebellion.}
~~~~

## Braceplate syntax

Templates can be specified in JSON or in the following plaintext shorthand

~~~~
100@template_author>Template title#past_tag1 past_tag2#future_tag1 future_tag2 future_tag3
The template itself, featuring $variables, ~nonterminals, [alternations|etc.]
If split over multiple lines, each line is treated as an alternation option, as with symbols.
~~~~

This defines a template with weight `100` by `@template_author`, with the title "Template title", and the specified past tags (`past_tag1` and `past_tag2`) and future tags (`future_tag1`, `future_tag2`, and `future_tag3`). 
The weight (`100`), author (`@template_author`), and past/future tags (everything from `#` onwards) can be omitted.

For an example, see [examples/markov/good_news_bad_news.txt](examples/markov/good_news_bad_news.txt).

## Using braceplates

### Web simulation

[Bracery message template demo](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ihh/bracery/blob/master/web/markov.html) (source in [web/markov.html](web/markov.html))

### Command line simulation

You can test template sequencing from the command line using bracery's `-m` option
(short for `--markov`, because it samples a trajectory through the Markov chain).
Make sure to also load any required symbol definitions.
For example:

~~~~
bracery -m examples/markov/good_news_bad_news.txt
~~~~

Or for an interactive experience that allows you to keep re-randomizing the next message in the thread until you're happy with it,
use bracery with the `-q` option (short for `--quiz`) instead of `-m`:

~~~~
bracery -q examples/markov/good_news_bad_news.txt
~~~~

### Visualization

You can also use the `templates2dot.js` script to get a visualization of the Markov chain as a GraphViz dot file
(the `-o` option will create and open the PDF automatically, but only on a Mac with GraphViz installed)

~~~~
bin/templates2dot.js -o examples/markov/good_news_bad_news.txt
~~~~
