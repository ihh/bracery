Bracery is a grammar-based language for procedural text generation.
It uses dollar-sign prefixes for variables (as in `&'{$x}`),
equals for assignment (`&'{$x=value}`),
curly-brace delimiters (`&'{$x={longer value}}`),
square-bracket alternations (`&'[first option|another option|third option]`) which can be nested (`&'[comme [Ã§i|ca]|like [this|that]]`),
ampersands for built-in function names (`&add`, `&subtract`, `&plural`, etc.),
conditionals (`&if`),
lists (`&map`, `&join`, `&reduce`),
access to several parsers (`&eval`, `&quote`, `&syntax`, `&parse`),
and a few other [features](https://github.com/ihh/bracery#Usage).
