# Bracery

Bracery.org is a wiki-like website for collaboratively experimenting with procedural text generation and interactive fiction.

The underlying engine of this site is the [Bracery language](https://github.com/ihh/bracery#Usage) for randomized procedural text generation.
As a programming language, Bracery combines the basic model of [Tracery](http://tracery.io/) by [Kate Compton](http://www.galaxykate.com/)
with some features from [Twine](http://twinery.org/) by [Chris Klimas](https://chrisklimas.com/).

This is the welcome page.
The Bracery source code for this page is visible if you click the \"Edit\" link, at the foot of this page.
The page's code is first expanded by the Bracery interpreter,
then converted from [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) to HTML.
